# NOTEPAD-APP

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
The app is a multi-user Notepad application.
 It allows users to create, edit, and manage their own notes under different accounts.
  The main goal is to provide a secure platform that protects user data while covering the essential note functions: create, delete, and edit.

  # FEATURES
 Users can easily interact with and access the app

User registration (username + password)

Includes basic error messages

One account per user, accessed through secure authentication

# TECH STACK
 JavaScript – main programming language

 HTML – structure of the frontend pages

CSS – styling for the frontend 

 Mongodb and Mongoose – database and data modeling

 Node.js and Express – backend framework
 
 CORS – handling cross-origin requests

dotenv – environment variable management

JWT – authentication tokens

bcrypt – password encryption


# Authentication Flow

The user fills out the registration form, which sends the data to the backend to create an account.
 During login, the form generates a JWT token, which is saved in local storage. 
 After a successful login, the Notepad app is displayed for the user.
  This ensures that each user has a secure account, and their notes are only accessible to them.
